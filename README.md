# CPEN-291-Project
The project focuses on creating a "Pet Management System" allowing users to remotely care for their pets through feeding, playing, and monitoring activities.

Features:
Webcam Streaming: The system offers a website that streams live webcam footage for users to monitor their pets remotely.
Activity Monitoring: Users can track feeding and litter box cleaning schedules through the website.
Remote Interaction: It enables users to remotely activate pet toys for interaction.
Auto Feeder Configuration: Users can set specific feeding times and portions through an auto feeder feature.
Travel Convenience: Designed to ensure pet safety when users are away, providing peace of mind during travels.
My Contributions:
Front-end Development: Constructed the website using JavaScript and HTML.
Video Streaming: Implemented webcam streaming across different networks, enabling users to view the feed without connecting to the same network as the webcam.
Hardware Development: Collaborated in building hardware components like the auto feeder and litterbox cleaner, utilizing Raspberry Pi components such as servo motors and pressure actuators.
This project integrates software and hardware to create a comprehensive solution for pet care and monitoring, facilitating remote pet management for users.
